## What is this:
* This is a simple one-page memory-game.

## How to play:
* By clicking on the first card the game starts. For every two cards that you clicked in a row, this game will add to the total game you play and check if they are a match. If they do match you will gain one point which will be added to your total score.  Otherwise, you neither gain any point nor lose any point. In case you want to start fresh, you can click the reset button and reset the whole game.
